LSTM RNNs, or Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, are powerful tools in the realm of time series forecasting. By leveraging the unique ability of LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, I'm employing them to predict future cryptocurrency prices. With historical price data as input, the LSTM model learns complex patterns and trends, enabling it to make informed predictions about future price movements. This approach not only provides valuable insights into market behavior but also offers potential opportunities for traders and investors to make data-driven decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrency trading.
